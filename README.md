## Summary
    What I created is a simple connect 4 game, where the objective is to get 4 consecutive chips
    in a row either horizontally or vertically in this 6x7 grid board.
    The game will switch turns after the opposing player selects their placement.

## Installation
    1. Clone the Repo
    2. Install NPM packages
    3. Run npm start

## How to Play
    1. Decide who will start off as player 1
    2. Player 1 will start the game by placing their first chip
    3. player 2 will then follow by strategiclly placing their first chip
    4. The aim of the game is for one player to get 4 chips in a row either horizontally and vertically 
    5. The game will cycle through each player until one places their 4th in a row
